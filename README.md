# DevOps Journey

This repository documents my transition from classical system administration towards DevOps.

It serves as a central place to track learning progress, document key concepts and link to hands-on projects.

## Goal

- Strengthen DevOps fundamentals
- Build production-like cloud infrastructure
- Improve automation, reliability and security practices
- Bridge the gap between development and operations

---

## Focus Areas

- Linux & Networking
- CI/CD pipelines
- Containerization
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Roadmap

My roadmap can be found here:
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md)

## Projects

Hands-on projects with real-world focus are documented separately:

Each project lives in its own repository and includes:

- Clear goals
